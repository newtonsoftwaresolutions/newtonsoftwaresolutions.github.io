<h3> Overview </h3><p>
Clone is an easy to use file backup utility. Clone can be configured to carry out automated backups of your critical data. Once you have configured Clone you need take no
further action to ensure all your important data is backed up<a href="index.html">,</a> it's all carried out automatically.<br>
<img src="summary.png" align=left vspace=10 hspace=10> Clone copies files from one location to another. Your files are copied "as is" making it very simple to recover after an unforeseen loss of data. 
Clone does not use any proprietary format
for storing your files, you won't even need a copy of Clone to restore your files, Windows Explorer will do the job. 
Clone will backup files to any media that can be mapped to a Windows directory, including UNC paths.
For example, you can backup to a second hard disk drive (internal or external), a CD-RW / DVD-RW drive, a floppy disk / USB storage device or a network file server.
You can use file filters to specify in detail which files you want backed up, e.g. *.doc will only backup your documents. 
Clone is very easy to run and configure. Clone keeps a track of how many files it has checked and copied so you always know what the program is doing.
